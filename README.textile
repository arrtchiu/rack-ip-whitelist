h1. IP Whitelist Middleware

h2. About

Rack Middleware for websites that need to contain access to a group of ip addresses (a whitelist). 
Outside these addresses, vistors are shown 401 Unauthorized page.

This particular fork is intended for use on Heroku, and where whitelisted IPs are either not behind proxies, and/or those proxies do not add `X-Forwarded-For` headers. This prevents malicious users spoofing the `X-Forwarded-For` headers by requiring an exact match.
